# learningGKE

This is a series of yaml files I'm using to practice Google kubernetes engine. :)

Suggestions and Ideas are welcome!!!

PS: most of this yaml file were developed on the google cloud platform console, running locally would warant you to install [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), [google cloud platform sdk](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install), [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [golang](https://go.dev/dl/) or any programming language of choice.
